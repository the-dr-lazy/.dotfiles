* Rudimentary Configuration

Make this file run (slightly) faster with lexical binding (see [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][this blog post]] for more info).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :comments no
;;; config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

** Personal Information
It's useful to have some basic personal information
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Mohammad Hasani"
      user-mail-address "the-dr-lazy@pm.me")
#+end_src
These are used for a number of things, particularly for ~GPG~ configuration, some email clients, file templates and snippets.

Speaking of ~GPG~, I want to use =~/.authsource.gpg= instead of the default in
=~/.emacs.d=. Why? Because my home directory is already cluttered, so this won't
make a difference, and I don't want to accidentaly purge this file (I have done
src_shell{rm -rf~/.emac.d~ before}. I also want to cache as much as possible, as
my home machine is pretty safe, and my laptop is shutdown a lot.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg")
      auth-source-cache-expiry nil) ; default is 7200 (2h)
#+end_src

** Better Defaults
*** Simple settings
Browsing the web and seeing [[https://github.com/angrybacon/dotemacs/blob/master/dotemacs.org#use-better-defaults][angrybacon/dotemacs]] and comparing with the values
shown by =SPC h v= and selecting what I thought looks good, I've ended up adding
the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default
 delete-by-moving-to-trash t                      ; Delete files to trash
 window-combination-resize t                      ; take new window space from all other windows (not just current)
 x-stretch-cursor t)                              ; Stretch cursor to the glyph width

(setq undo-limit 80000000                         ; Raise undo-limit to 80Mb
      evil-want-fine-undo t                       ; By default while in insert all changes are one big blob. Be more granular
      auto-save-default t                         ; Nobody likes to loose work, I certainly don't
      truncate-string-ellipsis "…"                ; Unicode ellispis are nicer than "...", and also save /precious/ space
      password-cache-expiry nil                   ; I can trust my computers ... can't I?
      ;; scroll-preserve-screen-position 'always     ; Don't have `point' jump around
      scroll-margin 2)                            ; It's nice to maintain a little margin

(global-auto-revert-mode t)                       ; Automatically update buffers
(display-time-mode 1)                             ; Enable time in the mode-line
(global-subword-mode 1)                           ; Iterate through CamelCase words
#+end_src

*** Frame sizing
It's nice to control the size of new frames, when launching Emacs that can be
done with src_shell{emacs -geometry 160x48}. After the font size adjustment
during initialisation this works out to be ~102x31~.

Thanks to hotkeys, it's easy for me to expand a frame to half/full-screen, so it
makes sense to be conservative with the sizing of new frames.

Then, for creating new frames within the same Emacs instance, we'll just set the
default to be something roughly 80% of that size.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(height . 24))
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(width . 80))
#+end_src

*** Auto-customisation
By default changes made via a customisation interface are added to =init.el=.
I prefer the idea of using a separate file for this. We just need to change a
setting, and load it if it exists.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default custom-file (expand-file-name ".custom.el" doom-private-dir))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))
#+end_src
*** Windows
First, we'll enter the new window
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq evil-vsplit-window-right t
      evil-split-window-below t)
#+end_src

Window rotation is nice, and can be found under =SPC w r= and =SPC w R=.
/Layout/ rotation is also nice though. Let's stash this under =SPC w SPC=, inspired
by Tmux's use of =C-b SPC= to rotate windows.

We could also do with adding the missing arrow-key variants of the window
navigation/swapping commands.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map evil-window-map
      "SPC" #'rotate-layout)
#+end_src
*** Buffer defaults
I'd much rather have my new buffers in ~org-mode~ than ~fundamental-mode~, hence
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (setq-default major-mode 'org-mode)
#+end_src
For some reason this + the mixed pitch hook causes issues with hydra and so I'll
just need to resort to =SPC b o= for now.
** Doom Configuration
*** Modules
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:
Doom has this lovely /modular configuration base/ that takes a lot of work out of
configuring Emacs. Each module (when enabled) can provide a list of packages to
install (on ~doom sync~) and configuration to be applied. The modules can also
have flags applied to tweak their behaviour.

#+name: init.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el" :noweb no-export :comments no
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load
;; in. Remember to run 'doom sync' after modifying it!

(doom! :input
       <<doom-input>>

       :completion
       <<doom-completion>>

       :ui
       <<doom-ui>>

       :editor
       <<doom-editor>>

       :emacs
       <<doom-emacs>>

       :term
       <<doom-term>>

       :checkers
       <<doom-checkers>>

       :tools
       <<doom-tools>>

       :os
       <<doom-os>>

       :lang
       <<doom-lang>>

       :app
       <<doom-app>>

       :config
       <<doom-config>>
       )
#+end_src
Press =K= on a module to view its documentation, and =gd= to browse its directory.

**** Structure
As you may have noticed by this point, this is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] configuration. Doom
has good support for this which we access though the ~literate~ module.

While we're in the src_elisp{:config} section, we'll use Dooms nicer defaults,
along with the bindings and smartparens behaviour (the flags aren't documented,
but they exist).
#+name: doom-config
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
literate
(default +bindings +smartparens)
#+end_src

**** Interface
There's a lot that can be done to enhance Emacs' capabilities.
I reckon enabling half the modules Doom provides should do it.

#+end_src

**** Language Support
We can be rather liberal with enabling support for languages as the associated
packages/configuration are (usually) only loaded when first opening an
associated file.

**** Everything In Emacs
It's just too convenient being able to have everything in Emacs.
I couldn't resist the Feed module.

#+name: doom-app
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
calendar                   ; A dated approach to timetabling
everywhere                   ; *leave* Emacs!? You must be joking.
irc                          ; how neckbeards socialize
(rss +org)                   ; emacs as an RSS reader
#+end_src

*** Visual Settings
**** Font Face
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "VictorMono Nerd Font" :size 18)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "VictorMono Nerd Font" :size 24)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Overpass" :size 19)
      doom-unicode-font (font-spec :family "JuliaMono")
      doom-serif-font (font-spec :family "IBM Plex Mono" :weight 'light))
#+end_src

I'm persian! Unfortunately. So I have better intuition over persian fonts than =unicode-fonts=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! unicode-fonts
  (add-to-list unicode-fonts-block-font-mapping '("Old Persian" . '("Farhang"))))
#+end_src

In addition to these fonts, Merriweather is used with =nov.el=, and Alegreya as a
serifed proportional font used by =mixed-pitch-mode= for =writeroom-mode= with Org
files.

Because we care about how things look let's add a check to make sure we're told
if the system doesn't have any of those fonts.
#+name: detect-missing-fonts
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defvar required-fonts '("VictorMono Nerd Font" "Overpass" "JuliaMono" "IBM Plex Mono" "Merriweather" "Alegreya"))

(defvar available-fonts
  (delete-dups (or (font-family-list)
                   (split-string (shell-command-to-string "fc-list : family")
                                 "[,\n]"))))

(defvar missing-fonts
  (delq nil (mapcar
             (lambda (font)
               (unless (delq nil (mapcar (lambda (f)
                                           (string-match-p (format "^%s$" font) f))
                                         available-fonts))
                 font))
             required-fonts)))

(if missing-fonts
    (pp-to-string
     `(unless noninteractive
        (add-hook! 'doom-init-ui-hook
          (run-at-time nil nil
                       (lambda ()
                         (message "%s missing the following fonts: %s"
                                  (propertize "Warning!" 'face '(bold warning))
                                  (mapconcat (lambda (font)

                                             ',missing-fonts
                                             ", "))
                         (sleep-for 0.5))))))
  ";; No missing fonts detected")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
<<detect-missing-fonts()>>
#+end_src
This way whenever fonts are missing, after Doom's UI has initialised, a warning
listing the missing fonts should appear for at least half a second.

Also, let's add some flavour to comments and keywords in the syntax.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(font-lock-comment-face :slant italic)
  '(font-lock-keyword-face :slant italic))
#+end_src

**** Bidirectional Editing
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun set-bidi-env ()
  (setq bidi-paragraph-direction 'nil
        bidi-paragraph-separate-re "^"
        bidi-paragraph-start-re "^"))

(add-hook! 'org-mode-hook 'set-bidi-env)
(add-hook! 'latex-mode-hook 'set-bidi-env)
(add-hook! 'markdown-mode-hook 'set-bidi-env)
#+end_src
**** Theme and Modeline
~doom-one~ is nice and all, but I find the ~moonlight~ variant nicer. Oh, and with the
nice selection doom provides there's no reason for me to want the defaults.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-moonlight)
(remove-hook 'window-setup-hook #'doom-init-theme-h)
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'doom-init-theme-h 'append)
(delq! t custom-theme-load-path)
(after! doom-themes
  (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t
        doom-themes-enable-italic t))

(after! doom-modeline
  (setq doom-modeline-bar-width 3
        doom-modeline-buffer-file-name-style 'file-name
        doom-modeline-icon t
        doom-modeline-major-mode-icon t))
#+end_src

However, by default ~red~ text is used in the ~modeline~, so let's make that orange
so I don't feel like something's gone /wrong/ when editing files.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(doom-modeline-buffer-modified :foreground "orange"))
#+end_src

**** Window Title
I'd like to have just the buffer name, then if applicable the project folder
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq frame-title-format
      '(""
        (:eval
         (if (s-contains-p org-roam-directory (or buffer-file-name ""))
             (replace-regexp-in-string
              ".*/[0-9]*-?" "☰ "
              (subst-char-in-string ?_ ?  buffer-file-name))
           "%b"))
        (:eval
         (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
           (unless (string= "-" project-name)
             (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+end_src

For example when I open my config file it the window will be titled =config.org ●
doom= then as soon as I make a change it will become =config.org ◉ doom=.
**** Splash Screen
Emacs can render an image as the splash screen! You know that fancy GNU head, ha? :)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq fancy-splash-image (concat doom-private-dir "media/gnu.png"))
#+end_src

Lastly, the doom dashboard "useful commands" are no longer useful to me.
So, we'll disable them and then for a particularly /clean/ look disable
the modeline and ~hl-line-mode~, then also hide the cursor.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq +doom-dashboard-functions '(doom-dashboard-widget-banner))
(add-hook! '+doom-dashboard-mode-hook (hide-mode-line-mode 1) (hl-line-mode -1))
(setq-hook! '+doom-dashboard-mode-hook evil-normal-state-cursor (list nil))
#+end_src
**** Ligatures
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq +ligatures-extra-symbols
      '(;; Functional
        :lambda "λ"
        :delta "∆"
        :left-composition "ᗕ"

**** Miscellaneous
Relative line numbers are fantastic for knowing how far away line numbers are,
then =ESC 12 <UP>= gets you exactly where you think.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+end_src

I'd like some slightly nicer default buffer names
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-fallback-buffer-name "► Doom"
      +doom-dashboard-name "► Doom")
#+end_src

*** Some Helper Macros
There are a few handy macros added by doom, namely
- ~load!~ for loading external ~.el~ files relative to this one
- ~use-package!~ for configuring packages
- ~add-load-path!~ for adding directories to the ~load-path~ where ~Emacs~ looks when
  you load packages with ~require~ or ~use-package~
- ~map!~ for binding new keys
*** Allow Babel Execution In CLI Actions
In this config I sometimes generate code to include in my config.
This works nicely, but for it to work with =doom sync= et. al. I need to make sure
that Org doesn't try to confirm that I want to allow evaluation (I do!).

Thankfully Doom supports =$DOOMDIR/cli.el= file which is sourced every time a CLI
command is run, so we can just enable evaluation by setting
~org-confirm-babel-evaluate~ to ~nil~ there.
While we're at it, we should silence ~org-babel-execute-src-block~ to
avoid polluting the output.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle cli.el :comments no
;;; cli.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)

(defun doom-shut-up-a (orig-fn &rest args)
  (quiet! (apply orig-fn args)))

(advice-add 'org-babel-execute-src-block :around #'doom-shut-up-a)
#+end_src
*** Asynchronous Config Tangling
Doom adds an =org-mode= hook ~+literate-enable-recompile-h~. This is a nice idea,
but it's too blocking for my taste. Since I trust my tangling to be fairly
straightforward, I'll just redefine it to a simpler, async, function.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! +literate-tangle-async-h ()
  "A very simplified version of `+literate-tangle-h', but async."
  :override #'+literate-tangle-h
  (let ((default-directory doom-private-dir))
    (async-shell-command
     (format "emacs --batch --eval \"(progn \
(require 'org) (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil) \
(org-babel-tangle-file \\\"%s\\\"))\""
             +literate-config-file))))
#+end_src

* Packages
This is where you install packages, by declaring them with the ~package!~ macro in
=packages.el=, then running ~doom refresh~ on the command line.
This file shouldn't be byte compiled.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "packages.el" :comments no
;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-
#+end_src

You'll then need to restart Emacs for your changes to take effect! Or at least,
run =M-x doom/reload=.

*Warning*: Don't disable core packages listed in =~/.emacs.d/core/packages.el=.
Doom requires these, and disabling them may have terrible side effects.
** Loading Instructions
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:
*** Packages In MELPA/ELPA/emacsmirror
To install ~some-package~ from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! some-package)
#+end_src

*** Packages From Git Repositories
To install a package directly from a particular repo, you'll need to specify
a ~:recipe~. You'll find documentation on what ~:recipe~ accepts [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format][here]]:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! another-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))
#+end_src

If the package you are trying to install does not contain a ~PACKAGENAME.el~
file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
~:files~ in the ~:recipe~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! this-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))
#+end_src

*** Disabling and Overriding Built-in Packages
If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, for whatever reason,
you can do so here with the ~:disable~ property:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :disable t)
#+end_src
You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
all the properties for ~:recipe~. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))
#+end_src

Specify a ~:branch~ to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
our package manager can't deal with; see [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/issues/279][raxod502/straight.el#279]])
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))
#+end_src

** Convenience
*** Rotate (window management)
The =rotate= package just adds the ability to rotate window layouts, but that
sounds nice to me.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! rotate
  :pin "4e9ac3ff800880bd9b705794ef0f7c99d72900a6")
#+end_src

*** Which-key
#+begin_quote
From the =:core packages= module.
#+end_quote

Let's make this popup a bit faster
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-idle-delay 0.8) ;; I need the help, I really do
#+end_src

I also think that having =evil-= appear in so many popups is a bit too verbose,
let's change that, and do a few other similar tweaks while we're at it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-allow-multiple-replacements t)
(after! which-key
  (pushnew!
   which-key-replacement-alist
   '(("" . "\\`+?evil[-:]?\\(?:a-\\)?\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "◂\\1"))
   '(("\\`g s" . "\\`evilem--?motion-\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "◃\\1"))
   ))
#+end_src

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Whichkey triggered on an evil motion

** Tools
*** GPG
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src
*** Abbrev
Thanks to [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/45462/use-a-single-abbrev-table-for-multiple-modes/45476#45476][use a single abbrev-table for multiple modes? - Emacs Stack Exchange]] I
have the following.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(add-hook 'doom-first-buffer-hook
          (defun +abbrev-file-name ()
            (setq-default abbrev-mode t)
            (setq abbrev-file-name (expand-file-name "abbrev.el" doom-private-dir))))
#+end_src
*** Very Large Files
The /very large files/ mode loads large files in chunks, allowing one to open
ridiculously large files.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! vlf
  :recipe (:host github :repo "m00natic/vlfi" :files ("*.el"))
  :pin "cc02f2533782d6b9b628cec7e2dcf25b2d05a27c")
#+end_src

To make VLF available without delaying startup, we'll just load it in quiet moments.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! vlf-setup
  :defer-incrementally vlf-tune vlf-base vlf-write vlf-search vlf-occur vlf-follow vlf-ediff vlf)
#+end_src

*** Eros
#+begin_quote
From the =:tools eval= module.
#+end_quote

This package enables the very nice inline evaluation with =gr= and =gR=. The prefix
could be slightly nicer though.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq eros-eval-result-prefix "==> ") ; default =>
#+end_src
*** EVIL
#+begin_quote
From the =:editor evil= module.
#+end_quote

When I want to make a substitution, I want it to be global more often than not
--- so let's make that the default.
Now, EVIL cares a fair bit about keeping compatibility with Vim's default
behaviour. I don't. There are some particular settings that I'd rather be
something else, so let's change them.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! evil
  (setq evil-ex-substitute-global t     ; I like my s/../.. to by global by default
        evil-move-cursor-back nil       ; Don't move the block cursor when toggling insert mode
        evil-move-beyond-eol t
        evil-kill-on-visual-paste nil)) ; Don't put overwritten text in the kill ring
#+end_src

EVIL by default uses =forwar-char= and =backward-char= commands which are not bidi-aware. (https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/892)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq visual-order-cursor-movement t)
(define-key evil-normal-state-map "h" 'left-char)
(define-key evil-normal-state-map "l" 'right-char)
(define-key evil-normal-state-map [left] 'left-char)
(define-key evil-normal-state-map [right] 'right-char)
(define-key evil-visual-state-map "h" 'left-char)
(define-key evil-visual-state-map "l" 'right-char)
(define-key evil-visual-state-map [left] 'left-char)
(define-key evil-visual-state-map [right] 'right-char)
#+end_src

*** Consult
#+begin_quote
From the =:completion vertico= module.
#+end_quote

Since we're using [[Marginalia]] too, the separation between buffers and files is
already clear, and there's no need for a different face.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! consult
  (set-face-attribute 'consult-file nil :inherit 'consult-buffer)
  (setf (plist-get (alist-get 'perl consult-async-split-styles-alist) :initial) ";"))
#+end_src
*** Smerge
For repeated operations, a hydra would be helpful. But I prefer transient.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun smerge-repeatedly ()
  "Perform smerge actions again and again"
  (interactive)
  (smerge-mode 1)
  (smerge-transient))

(after! transient
  (transient-define-prefix smerge-transient ()
    [["Move"
      ("n" "next" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-next)) (smerge-repeatedly)))

      ("q" "quit" (lambda () (interactive) (smerge-auto-leave)))]]))
#+end_src

*** Company
#+begin_quote
From the =:completion company= module.
#+end_quote

It's nice to have completions almost all the time, in my opinion. Key strokes
are just waiting to be saved!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! company
  (setq company-idle-delay 0.5
        company-minimum-prefix-length 2)
  (setq company-show-numbers t)
  (add-hook 'evil-normal-state-entry-hook #'company-abort)) ;; make aborting less annoying.
#+end_src

Now, the improvements from ~precedent~ are mostly from remembering history, so
let's improve that memory.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default history-length 1000)
(setq-default prescient-history-length 1000)
#+end_src

**** Plain Text
~Ispell~ is nice, let's have it in ~text~, ~markdown~, and ~GFM~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-company-backend!
  '(text-mode
    markdown-mode
    gfm-mode)
  '(:seperate
    company-ispell
    company-files
    company-yasnippet))
#+end_src
We then configure the dictionary we're using in [[*Ispell][Ispell]].
*** Projectile
#+begin_quote
From the =:core packages= module.
#+end_quote

Looking at documentation via =SPC h f= and =SPC h v= and looking at the source can
add package src directories to projectile. This isn't desirable in my opinion.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq projectile-ignored-projects '("~/" "/tmp" "~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repos/"))
(defun projectile-ignored-project-function (filepath)
  "Return t if FILEPATH is within any of `projectile-ignored-projects'"
  (or (mapcar (lambda (p) (s-starts-with-p p filepath)) projectile-ignored-projects)))
#+end_src
*** TRAMP
Another lovely Emacs feature, TRAMP stands for /Transparent Remote Access,
Multiple Protocol/. In brief, it's a lovely way to wander around outside your
local filesystem.

**** Prompt recognition
Unfortunately, when connecting to remote machines Tramp can be a wee pit picky
with the prompt format. Let's try to get Bash, and be a bit more permissive with
prompt recognition.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! tramp
  (setenv "SHELL" "/bin/bash")
  (setq tramp-shell-prompt-pattern "\\(?:^\\|

*** Info Colours

*** Theme Magic
With all our fancy Emacs themes, my terminal is missing out!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! theme-magic
  :pin "844c4311bd26ebafd4b6a1d72ddcc65d87f074e3")
#+end_src

Let's automatically update terminals on theme change (as long as ~pywal~ is available).

Unfortunately, as the theme is set on startup this causes the hook to be run
immediately. It would be nicer to /not/ have this add to our precious startup
time (around 0.4s last time I checked).
We can achieve this by deferring it with a short idle timer that should add the
hook /just after/ initialisation.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (executable-find "wal") "yes" "no")
(run-with-idle-timer 0.1 nil (lambda () (add-hook 'doom-load-theme-hook 'theme-magic-from-emacs)))
#+end_src
*** Emojify
#+begin_quote
From the =:ui emoji= module.
#+end_quote

For starters, twitter's emojis look nicer than emoji-one.
Other than that, this is pretty great OOTB 😀.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq emojify-emoji-set "twemoji-v2")
#+end_src

One minor annoyance is the use of emojis over the default character
when the default is actually preferred. This occurs with overlay symbols I use
in Org mode, such as checkbox state, and a few other miscellaneous cases.

We can accommodate our preferences by deleting those entries from the emoji hash
table

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar emojify-disabled-emojis
  '(;; Org
    "◼" "☑" "☸" "⚙" "⏩" "⏪" "⬆" "⬇" "❓"
    ;; Terminal powerline

  "Characters that should never be affected by `emojify-mode'.")

#+end_src
*** Doom Modeline
#+begin_quote
From the =:ui modeline= module.
#+end_quote

While we're modifying the modeline, =LF UTF-8= is the default file encoding, and
thus not worth noting in the modeline. So, let's conditionally hide it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding ()
  "We expect the encoding to be LF UTF-8, so only show the modeline when this is not the case"
  (setq-local doom-modeline-buffer-encoding
              (unless (and (memq (plist-get (coding-system-plist buffer-file-coding-system) :category)
                                 '(coding-category-undecided coding-category-utf-8))
                           (not (memq (coding-system-eol-type buffer-file-coding-system) '(1 2))))
                t)))

(add-hook 'after-change-major-mode-hook #'doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding)
#+end_src

Very nice and pretty, however I think the PDF modeline could do with tweaking.
I raised [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline/pull/425][an issue]] on this, however the response was basically "put your
preferences in your personal config, the current default is sensible" --- so
here we are.
First up I'm going to want a segment for just the buffer file name, and a PDF
icon. Then we'll redefine two functions used to generate the modeline.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (concat
     (doom-modeline-spc)

*** Mixed Pitch
#+begin_quote
From the =:ui zen= module.
#+end_quote

We'd like to use mixed pitch in certain modes. If we simply add a hook, when
directly opening a file with (a new) Emacs =mixed-pitch-mode= runs before UI
initialisation, which is problematic. To resolve this, we create a hook that
runs after UI initialisation and both
+ conditionally enables =mixed-pitch-mode=
+ sets up the mixed pitch hooks

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar mixed-pitch-modes '(org-mode LaTeX-mode markdown-mode gfm-mode Info-mode)
  "Modes that `mixed-pitch-mode' should be enabled in, but only after UI initialisation.")
(defun init-mixed-pitch-h ()
  "Hook `mixed-pitch-mode' into each mode in `mixed-pitch-modes'.
Also immediately enables `mixed-pitch-modes' if currently in one of the modes."
  (when (memq major-mode mixed-pitch-modes)
    (mixed-pitch-mode 1))
  (dolist (hook mixed-pitch-modes)
    (add-hook (intern (concat (symbol-name hook) "-hook")) #'mixed-pitch-mode)))
(add-hook 'doom-init-ui-hook #'init-mixed-pitch-h)
#+end_src

As mixed pitch uses the variable =mixed-pitch-face=, we can create a new function
to apply mixed pitch with a serif face instead of the default. This was created
for =writeroom-mode=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(autoload #'mixed-pitch-serif-mode "mixed-pitch"
  "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch." t)

(after! mixed-pitch
  (defface variable-pitch-serif
    '((t (:family "serif")))
    "A variable-pitch face with serifs."
    :group 'basic-faces)
  (setq mixed-pitch-set-height t)
  (setq variable-pitch-serif-font (font-spec :family "Alegreya" :size 19))
  (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch-serif nil :font variable-pitch-serif-font)
  (defun mixed-pitch-serif-mode (&optional arg)
    "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch."
    (interactive)
    (let ((mixed-pitch-face 'variable-pitch-serif))
      (mixed-pitch-mode (or arg 'toggle)))))
#+end_src

Now, as Harfbuzz is currently used in Emacs, we'll be missing out on the
following Alegreya ligatures:
#+begin_center
ff /ff/ ffi /ffi/ ffj /ffj/ ffl /ffl/
fft /fft/ fi /fi/ fj /fj/ ft /ft/
Th /Th/
#+end_center

Thankfully, it isn't too hard to add these to the ~composition-function-table~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-char-table-range composition-function-table ?f '(["\\(?:ff?[fijlt]\\)" 0 font-shape-gstring]))

tweaks. Namely:

*** File Templates

It's nice to see ANSI colour codes displayed. However, until Emacs 28 it's not
possible to do this without modifying the buffer, so let's condition this block

By default, ~visual-line-mode~ is turned =on=, and ~auto-fill-mode~ =off= by a hook.
However this messes with tables in Org-mode, and other plaintext files (e.g.
markdown, \LaTeX) so I'll turn it off for this, and manually enable it for more
specific modes as desired.

**** Nicer Heading IDs Generation
Thanks to alphapapa's [[https://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el#export-to-html-with-useful-anchors][unpackaged.el]].

By default, Org generated heading IDs like =#org80fc2a5= which ... works, but has
two issues
+ It's completely uninformative, I have no idea what's being referenced
+ If I export the same file, everything will change.
  Now, while without hardcoded values it's impossible to set references in
  stone, it would be nice for there to be a decent chance of staying the same.

Both of these issues can be addressed by generating IDs like
=#language-configuration=, which is what I'll do here.

It's worth noting that alphapapa's use of ~url-hexify-string~ seemed to cause me
some issues. Replacing that in ~a53899~ resolved this for me. To go one step
further, I create a function for producing nice short links, like an inferior
version of ~reftex-label~.

**** Snippet Helpers
I often want to set =src-block= headers, and it's a pain to
+ type them out
+ remember what the accepted values are
+ oh, and specifying the same language again and again

We can solve this in three steps
+ having one-letter snippets, conditioned on ~(point)~ being within a src header
+ creating a nice prompt showing accepted values and the current default
+ pre-filling the =src-block= language with the last language used

For header args, the keys I'll use are
+ =r= for =:results=
+ =e= for =:exports=
+ =v= for =:eval=
+ =s= for =:session=
+ =d= for =:dir=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-src-header-p ()
  "Determine whether `point' is within a src-block header or header-args."
  (pcase (org-element-type (org-element-context))
    ('src-block (< (point) ; before code part of the src-block
                   (save-excursion (goto-char (org-element-property :begin (org-element-context)))
                                   (forward-line 1)
                                   (point))))
    ('inline-src-block (< (point) ; before code part of the inline-src-block
                          (save-excursion (goto-char (org-element-property :begin (org-element-context)))
                                          (search-forward "]{")
                                          (point))))
    ('keyword (string-match-p "^header-args" (org-element-property :value (org-element-context))))))
#+end_src

Now let's write a function we can reference in yasnippets to produce a nice
interactive way to specify header args.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-prompt-header-arg (arg question values)
  "Prompt the user to set ARG header property to one of VALUES with QUESTION.
The default value is identified and indicated. If either default is selected,
or no selection is made: nil is returned."
  (let* ((src-block-p (not (looking-back "^#\\+property:[ \t]+header-args:.*" (line-beginning-position))))
         (default
           (or
            (cdr (assoc arg
                        (if src-block-p
                            (nth 2 (org-babel-get-src-block-info t))
                          (org-babel-merge-params
                           org-babel-default-header-args
                           (let ((lang-headers
                                  (intern (concat "org-babel-default-header-args:"
                                                  (+yas/org-src-lang)))))
                             (when (boundp lang-headers) (eval lang-headers t)))))))
            ""))
         default-value)
    (setq values (mapcar
                  (lambda (value)
                    (if (string-match-p (regexp-quote value) default)
                        (setq default-value
                              (concat value " "
                                      (propertize "(default)" 'face 'font-lock-doc-face)))
                      value))
                  values))
    (let ((selection (consult--read question values :default default-value)))
      (unless (or (string-match-p "(default)$" selection)
                  (string= "" selection))
        selection))))
#+end_src

Finally, we fetch the language information for new source blocks.

Since we're getting this info, we might as well go a step further and also
provide the ability to determine the most popular language in the buffer that
doesn't have any =header-args= set for it (with =#+properties=).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-src-lang ()
  "Try to find the current language of the src/header at `point'.
Return nil otherwise."
  (let ((context (org-element-context)))

      ('src-block (org-element-property :language context))
      ('inline-src-block (org-element-property :language context))
      ('keyword (when (string-match "^header-args:\\([^ ]+\\)" (org-element-property :value context))
                  (match-string 1 (org-element-property :value context)))))))

(defun +yas/org-last-src-lang ()
  "Return the language of the last src-block, if it exists."
  (save-excursion
    (beginning-of-line)
    (when (re-search-backward "^[ \t]*#\\+begin_src" nil t)
      (org-element-property :language (org-element-context)))))

(defun +yas/org-most-common-no-property-lang ()
  "Find the lang with the most source blocks that has no global header-args, else nil."
  (let (src-langs header-langs)
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+begin_src" nil t)
        (push (+yas/org-src-lang) src-langs))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+property: +header-args" nil t)
        (push (+yas/org-src-lang) header-langs)))

    (setq src-langs
          (mapcar #'car
                  ;; sort alist by frequency (desc.)
                  (sort

                   (cl-loop for (n . m) in (seq-group-by #'identity src-langs)

**** Translate Capital Keywords (Old) To Lower Case (New)
Everyone used to use ~#+CAPITAL~ keywords. Then people realised that ~#+lowercase~
is actually both marginally easier and visually nicer, so now the capital
version is just used in the manual.
#+begin_quote
Org is standardized on lower case. Uppercase is used in the manual as a poor
man's bold, and supported for historical reasons. --- [[https://orgmode.org/list/87tuuw3n15.fsf@nicolasgoaziou.fr][Nicolas Goaziou on the Org ML]]
#+end_quote

To avoid sometimes having to choose between the hassle out of updating old
documents and using mixed syntax, I'll whip up a basic transcode-y function.
It likely misses some edge cases, but should mostly work.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-syntax-convert-keyword-case-to-lower ()
  "Convert all #+KEYWORDS to #+keywords."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (let ((count 0)
          (case-fold-search nil))
      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+[A-Z_]+" nil t)
        (unless (s-matches-p "RESULTS" (match-string 0))
          (replace-match (downcase (match-string 0)) t)
          (setq count (1+ count))))

**** Extra Links
***** YouTube
The ~[[yt:...]]~ links preview nicely, but don't export nicely. Thankfully, we can
fix that.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-link-set-parameters "yt" :export #'+org-export-yt)
(defun +org-export-yt (path desc backend _com)
  (cond ((org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'html)
         (format "<iframe width='440' \

        ((org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex)

#+end_src
**** Fix Problematic Hooks
When one of the src_elisp{org-mode-hook} functions errors, it halts the hook
execution. This is problematic, and there are two hooks in particular which
cause issues. Let's make their failure less eventful.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! shut-up-org-problematic-hooks (orig-fn &rest args)
  :around #'org-fancy-priorities-mode
  :around #'org-superstar-mode

#+end_src
*** Visuals
Here I try to do two things: improve the styling of the various documents, via
font changes etc, and also propagate colours from the current theme.

**** Font Display
Mixed pitch is great. As is ~+org-pretty-mode~, let's use them.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'+org-pretty-mode)
#+end_src

Let's make headings a bit bigger
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(outline-1 :weight extra-bold :height 1.25)
  '(outline-2 :weight bold :height 1.15)
  '(outline-3 :weight bold :height 1.12)
  '(outline-4 :weight semi-bold :height 1.09)
  '(outline-5 :weight semi-bold :height 1.06)
  '(outline-6 :weight semi-bold :height 1.03)
  '(outline-8 :weight semi-bold)
  '(outline-9 :weight semi-bold))
#+end_src

And the same with the title.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(org-document-title :height 1.2))
#+end_src

It seems reasonable to have deadlines in the error face when they're passed.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-deadline-faces
      '((1.001 . error)
        (1.0 . org-warning)
        (0.5 . org-upcoming-deadline)
        (0.0 . org-upcoming-distant-deadline)))
#+end_src

We can then have quote blocks stand out a bit more by making them /italic/.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t)
#+end_src
**** Fontifying Inline Src Blocks
Org does lovely things with =#+begin_src= blocks, like using font-lock for
language's major-mode behind the scenes and pulling out the lovely colourful
results. By contrast, inline =src_= blocks are somewhat neglected.

I am not the first person to feel this way, thankfully others have [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20309842/how-to-syntax-highlight-for-org-mode-inline-source-code-src-lang/28059832][taken to
stackexchange]] to voice their desire for inline src fontification. I was going to
steal their work, but unfortunately they didn't perform /true/ source code
fontification, but simply applied the =org-code= face to the content.

We can do better than that, and we shall! Using ~org-src-font-lock-fontify-block~
we can apply language-appropriate syntax highlighting. Then, continuing on to
={{{results(...)}}}= , it can have the =org-block= face applied to match, and then
the value-surrounding constructs hidden by mimicking the behaviour of
~prettify-symbols-mode~.

#+begin_warning
This currently only highlights a single inline src block per line.
I have no idea why it stops, but I'd rather it didn't.
If you have any idea what's going on or how to fix this /please/ get in touch.

**** Symbols
It's also nice to change the character used for collapsed items (by default ~…~),

and add an extra ~org-bullet~ to the default list of four.

**** LaTeX Fragments
***** Prettier Highlighting
First off, we want those fragments to look good.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(native script entities))
#+end_src

However, by using =native= highlighting the =org-block= face is added, and that
doesn't look too great --- particularly when the fragments are previewed.

Ideally ~org-src-font-lock-fontify-block~ wouldn't add the =org-block= face, but we
can avoid advising that entire function by just adding another face with
=:inherit default= which will override the background colour.

Inspecting ~org-do-latex-and-related~ shows that ="latex"= is the language argument
passed, and so we can override the background as discussed above.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-src)
(add-to-list 'org-src-block-faces '("latex" (:inherit default :extend t)))
#+end_src
***** More Eager Rendering
What's better than syntax-highlighted LaTeX is /rendered/ LaTeX though, and we can
have this be performed automatically with =org-fragtog=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle packages.el
(package! org-fragtog
  :pin "479e0a1c3610dfe918d89a5f5a92c8aec37f131d")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle yes
(use-package! org-fragtog
  :hook (org-mode . org-fragtog-mode))
#+end_src
***** Prettier Rendering
It's nice to customise the look of LaTeX fragments so they fit better in the
text --- like this \(\sqrt{\beta^2+3}-\sum_{\phi=1}^\infty \frac{x^\phi-1}{\Gamma(a)}\).
Let's start by adding a sans font. I'd also like to use some of the
functionality from =bmc-maths=, so we'll load that too.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-format-latex-header "\\documentclass{article}
\\usepackage[usenames]{xcolor}

\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\\usepackage{booktabs}

\\pagestyle{empty}             % do not remove

*** Exporting
**** General Settings
By default Org only exports the first three levels of headings as ... headings.
This is rather unfortunate as my documents frequently stray far beyond three
levels of depth. The two main formats I care about exporting to are LaTeX and
HTML. When using an =article= class, LaTeX headlines go from =\section=,
=\subsection=, =\subsubsection=, and =\paragraph= to =\subgraph= --- /five/ levels.
HTML5 has six levels of headings (=<h1>= to =<h6>=), but first level Org headings
get exported as =<h2>= elements --- leaving /five/ usable levels.

As such, it would seem to make sense to recognise the first /five/ levels of Org
headings when exporting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-headline-levels 5) ; I like nesting
#+end_src

I'm also going to make use of an item in =ox-extra= so that I can add an =:ignore:=
tag to headings for the content to be kept, but the heading itself ignored
(unlike =:noexport:= which ignored both heading and content). This is useful when
I want to use headings to provide a structure for writing that doesn't appear in
the final documents.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-extra)

Since I (roughly) track Org ~HEAD~, it makes sense to include the git version in

We want to tack on a few more bits to the start of the body. Unfortunately, there
doesn't seem to be any nice variable or hook, so we'll just override the

implement a CSS-only light/dark theme toggle, and a sprinkle of [[https://ogp.me/][Open Graph]]

**** Collapsable =src= and =example= Blocks
By wrapping the ~<pre>~ element in a ~<details>~ block, we can obtain collapsable
blocks with no CSS, though we will toss a little in anyway to have this looking
somewhat spiffy.

Since this collapsability seems useful to have on by default for certain chunks
of code, it would be nice if you could set it with =#+attr_html: :collapsed t=.

It would be nice to also have a corresponding global / session-local way of
setting this, but I haven't quite been able to get that working (yet).

(add-to-list 'org-default-properties "EXPORT_COLLAPSED")

We can take our src block modification a step further, and add a gutter on the
side of the src block containing both an anchor referencing the current block,
and a button to copy the content of the block.

**** Include extra font-locking in htmlize

Org uses [[https://github.com/hniksic/emacs-htmlize][htmlize.el]] to export buffers with syntax highlighting.

The works fantastically, for the most part. Minor modes that provide
font-locking are /not/ loaded, and so do not impact the result.

By enabling these modes in ~htmlize-before-hook~ we can correct this behaviour.

**** Handle table overflow
In order to accommodate wide tables ---particularly on mobile devices--- we want
to set a maximum width and scroll overflow. Unfortunately, this cannot be applied
directly to the ~table~ element, so we have to wrap it in a ~div~.

While we're at it, we can a link gutter, as we did with src blocks, and show the
~#+name~, if one is given.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-html-table-wrapped (orig-fn table contents info)

**** TOC as a collapsable tree
The TOC is much nicer to navigate as a collapsable tree. Unfortunately we cannot
achieve this with CSS alone. Thankfully we can avoid JS though, by adapting the
TOC generation code to use a ~label~ for each item, and a hidden ~checkbox~ to keep
track of state.

To add this, we need to change one line in [[file:~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repos/org-mode/lisp/ox-html.el::(format "<a href=\"#%s\">%s</a>"][org-html--format-toc-headline]].

Since we can actually accomplish the desired effect by adding advice /around/ the
function, without overriding it --- let's do that to reduce the bug surface of
this config a tad.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-html--format-toc-headline-colapseable (orig-fn headline info)
  "Add a label and checkbox to `org-html--format-toc-headline's usual output,
to allow the TOC to be a collapseable tree."
  :around #'org-html--format-toc-headline
  (if (or (not org-fancy-html-export-mode) (bound-and-true-p org-msg-export-in-progress))
      (funcall orig-fn headline info)
    (let ((id (or (org-element-property :CUSTOM_ID headline)
                  (org-export-get-reference headline info))))
      (format "<input type='checkbox' id='toc--%s'/><label for='toc--%s'>%s</label>"
              id id (funcall orig-fn headline info)))))
#+end_src

Now, leaves (headings with no children) shouldn't have the ~label~ item. The
obvious way to achieve this is by including some /if no children.../ logic in
~org-html--format-toc-headline-colapseable~. Unfortunately, I can't my elisp isn't
up to par to extract the number of child headings from the mountain of info that
org provides.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-html--toc-text-stripped-leaves (orig-fn toc-entries)
  "Remove label"
  :around #'org-html--toc-text
  (if (or (not org-fancy-html-export-mode) (bound-and-true-p org-msg-export-in-progress))
      (funcall orig-fn toc-entries)
    (replace-regexp-in-string "<input [^>]+><label [^>]+>\\(.+?\\)</label></li>" "\\1</li>"
                              (funcall orig-fn toc-entries))))
#+end_src
**** Make verbatim different to code
Since we have =verbatim= and ~code~, let's make use of the difference.

We can use ~code~ exclusively for code snippets and commands like: "calling
src_elisp{(message "Hello")} in batch-mode Emacs prints to stdout like ~echo~".
Then we can use =verbatim= for miscellaneous 'other monospace' like keyboard
shortcuts: "either =C-c C-c= or =C-g= is likely the most useful keybinding in Emacs",
or file names: "I keep my configuration in =~/.config/doom/=", among other things.

Then, styling these two cases differently can help improve clarity in a document.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-html-text-markup-alist
      '((bold . "<b>%s</b>")
        (code . "<code>%s</code>")
        (italic . "<i>%s</i>")
        (strike-through . "<del>%s</del>")
        (underline . "<span class=\"underline\">%s</span>")

#+end_src
**** Change checkbox type

             (on . "<span class='checkbox'></span>")

**** Extra special strings
The ~org-html-special-string-regexps~ variable defines substitutions for:
+ =\-=, a shy hyphen
+ =---=, an em dash
+ =--=, an en dash
+ =...=, (horizontal) ellipses

However I think it would be nice if there was also a substitution for left/right
arrows (=->= and =<-=). This is a ~defconst~, but as you may tell from the amount of
advice in this config, I'm not above messing with things I'm not 'supposed' to.

The only minor complication is that =<= and =>= are converted to =&lt;= and =&gt;=
before this stage of output processing.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(pushnew! org-html-special-string-regexps

       "<h\\1 id=\"\\2\">\\3<a aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#\\2\">#</a> </h\\1>"

**** Link previews
Sometimes it's nice to make a link particularly prominent, an embed/preview like
Twitter does would be nice I think.

We can do this without too much trouble by adding a new link type ever so
slightly different from =https= --- =Https=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-link-set-parameters "Https"
                         :follow (lambda (url arg) (browse-url (concat "https:" url) arg))
                         :export #'org-url-fancy-export)
#+end_src

Then, if we can fetch a plist of the form src_elisp{(:title "..." :description
"..." :image "...")} for such links via a function ~org-url-unfurl-metadata~, we
can make a fancy export.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-url-fancy-export (url _desc backend)
  (let ((metadata (org-url-unfurl-metadata (concat "https:" url))))
    (cond
     ((org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'html)
      (concat
       "<div class=\"link-preview\">"
       (format "<a href=\"%s\">" (concat "https:" url))
       (when (plist-get metadata :image)
         (format "<img src=\"%s\"/>" (plist-get metadata :image)))
       "<small>"
       (replace-regexp-in-string "//\\(?:www\\.\\)?\\([^/]+\\)/?.*" "\\1" url)
       "</small><p>"
       (when (plist-get metadata :title)
         (concat "<b>" (org-html-encode-plain-text (plist-get metadata :title)) "</b></br>"))
       (when (plist-get metadata :description)
         (org-html-encode-plain-text (plist-get metadata :description)))
       "</p></a></div>"))
     (t url))))
#+end_src

Now we just need to actually implement that metadata extraction function.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-url-unfurl-metadata--cache nil)
(defun org-url-unfurl-metadata (url)
  (cdr (or (assoc url org-url-unfurl-metadata--cache)

                                                                (url-retrieve-synchronously url t t 5))

***** MathJax
If MathJax is used, we want to use version 3 instead of the default version 2.
Looking at a [[https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php][comparison]] we seem to find that it is ~5 times as fast, uses a
single file instead of multiple, but seems to be a bit bigger unfortunately.
Thankfully this can be mitigated my adding the ~async~ attribute to defer loading.

*** LaTeX Export
**** Compiling
By default Org uses ~pdflatex~ \times 3 + ~bibtex~. This simply won't do in our
modern world. ~latexmk~ + ~biber~ (which is used automatically with ~latexmk~) is a
simply superior combination.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; org-latex-compilers = ("pdflatex" "xelatex" "lualatex"), which are the possible values for %latex
(setq org-latex-pdf-process '("latexmk -f -pdf -%latex -shell-escape -interaction=nonstopmode -output-directory=%o %f"))
#+end_src

While ~org-latex-pdf-process~ does support a function, and we could use that
instead, this would no longer use the log buffer --- it's a bit blind, you give
it the file name and expect it to do its thing.

The default values of ~org-latex-compilers~ is given in commented form to see how
~org-latex-pdf-process~ works with them.

While the ~-%latex~ above is slightly hacky (~-pdflatex~ expects to be given a
value) it allows us to leave ~org-latex-compilers~ unmodified.
This is nice in case I open an org file that uses =#+LATEX_COMPILER= for example,
it should still work.

**** A Cleverer Preamble
***** Use case
We often want particular snippets of LaTeX in our documents preambles.
It's a pain to have to work out / remember them every time.
For example, I almost always want to include the snippet below.

#+name: org-latex-embed-files-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\usepackage[main,include]{embedall}
\\IfFileExists{./\\jobname.org}{\\embedfile[desc=The original file]{\\jobname.org}}{}
#+end_src

We could have every package we could possibly need in every one of
~org-latex-classes~, but that's /horribly/ inefficient and I don't want to think
about maintaining that.

Instead we can provide some granularity by splitting up the features we want,
and then take the experience to a whole new level by implementing a system to
automatically detect which features are desired and generating a preamble that
provides these features.
***** Conditional Content
Let's consider content we want in particular situations.

Captions could do with a bit of tweaking such that
+ You can easily have multiple captions
+ Links to figures take you to the /top/ of the figure (not the bottom)
+ Caption labels could do with being emphasised slightly more
+ Multiline captions should run ragged-right, but only when then span more than
  one line

#+name: org-latex-caption-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\usepackage{subcaption}
\\usepackage[hypcap=true]{caption}
\\setkomafont{caption}{\\sffamily\\small}
\\setkomafont{captionlabel}{\\upshape\\bfseries}
\\captionsetup{justification=raggedright,singlelinecheck=true}
\\usepackage{capt-of} % required by Org
#+end_src

The default checkboxes look rather ugly, so let's provide some prettier alternatives.
#+name: org-latex-checkbox-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\newcommand{\\checkboxUnchecked}{$\\square$}
\\newcommand{\\checkboxTransitive}{\\rlap{\\raisebox{-0.1ex}{\\hspace{0.35ex}\\Large\\textbf -}}$\\square$}
\\newcommand{\\checkboxChecked}{\\rlap{\\raisebox{0.2ex}{\\hspace{0.35ex}\\scriptsize \\ding{52}}}$\\square$}
#+end_src

It's nice to have "message blocks", things like info/warning/error/success.
A LaTeX macro should make them trivial to create.
#+name: org-latex-box-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
% args = #1 Name, #2 Colour, #3 Ding, #4 Label
\\newcommand{\\defsimplebox}[4]{%
  \\definecolor{#1}{HTML}{#2}
  \\newenvironment{#1}[1][]
  {%
    \\par\\vspace{-0.7\\baselineskip}%
    \\textcolor{#1}{#3} \\textcolor{#1}{\\textbf{\\def\\temp{##1}\\ifx\\temp\\empty#4\\else##1\\fi}}%
    \\vspace{-0.8\\baselineskip}
    \\begin{addmargin}[1em]{1em}
  }{%
    \\end{addmargin}
    \\vspace{-0.5\\baselineskip}
  }%
}
#+end_src

Lastly, we will pass this content into some global variables we for ease of
access.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(defvar org-latex-embed-files-preamble "
<<org-latex-embed-files-preamble>>
"
  "Preamble that embeds files within the pdf.")

(defvar org-latex-caption-preamble "
<<org-latex-caption-preamble>>
"
  "Preamble that improves captions.")

(defvar org-latex-checkbox-preamble "
<<org-latex-checkbox-preamble>>
"
  "Preamble that improves checkboxes.")

(defvar org-latex-box-preamble "
<<org-latex-box-preamble>>
"
  "Preamble that provides a macro for custom boxes.")
#+end_src

In the "universal preamble", we already embed the source =.org= file, but it would
be nice to embed all the tangled files. This is fairly easy to accomplish by
mapping each tangled file to a form which embeds the file if it exists.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-embed-tangled-files ()
  "Return a string that uses embedfile to embed all tangled files."
  (mapconcat
   (lambda (tangle-file)
     (format "\\IfFileExists{%1$s}{\\embedfile[desc=Tangled %2$s file]{%1$s}}{}"
             (->> (car tangle-file)
               (replace-regexp-in-string "\\\\" "\\\\\\\\")
               (replace-regexp-in-string "~" "\\\\string~"))
             (cdr tangle-file)))
   (mapcar (lambda (f-block) (cons (or (car f-block) (caddr (cadr f-block))) (caadr f-block)))
           (org-babel-tangle-collect-blocks)) ; all files being tangled to
   "\n"))
#+end_src
***** Content-feature-preamble Association
Initially this idea was implemented with an alist that associated a construct
that would search the current Org file for an indication that some feature was
needed, with a LaTeX snippet to be inserted in the preamble which would provide
that feature.
This is all well and good when there is a bijection between detected features
and the LaTeX code needed to support those features, but in many cases this
relation is not injective.

To better model the reality of the situation, I add an extra layer to this
process where each detected feature gives a list of required "feature flags".
Simply be merging the lists of feature flags we no longer have to require
injectivity to avoid LaTeX duplication. Then the extra layer forms a bijection
between there feature flags and a specification which can be used to implement
the feature.

This model also provides a number of nice secondary benefits, such as a simple
implementation of feature dependency.

First we will implement the feature detection component of this model. I'd like
this to be able to use as much state information as possible, so the feature
tests should be very versatile.

and the cdr is either a single feature symbol or list of feature symbols.

The feature is registered as present when there is a match.

The car can also be a
- symbol, the value of which is fetched
- function, which is called with info as an argument
- list, which is `eval'uated

If the symbol, function, or list produces a string: that is used as a regex
search in the buffer. Otherwise any non-nil return value will indicate the
existance of the feature.")
#+end_src

Then we provide a way to generate the preamble that provides those features.
In addition to the features named in ~org-latex-conditional-features~ we'll also
create /meta-features/, which can be required by other features (with =:requires=),
or be active by default (=:eager t=). For further control I some features may only
be used when certain other features are active (with =:when=), and masked by other
features (with =:prevents=). I will use the convention of starting meta-features
with =.=, and =:eager= features with =!= to make their nature more readily apparent.

Another consideration in LaTeX is load order, which matters in some cases.
Beyond that, it's nice to have some sort of sensible ordering. For this I'll
introduce an =:order= keyword. Using this I'll arrange snippets as follows.

+ =-2= Embed files setup
+ =-1= Extra file embedding
+ =0= Typography
  - =0= Fonts themselves
  - =0.1= Typographic tweaks (=microtype=)
  - =0.2= Maths setup
  - =0.3= Maths font
  - =0.4= Extra text shaping (~\acr~)
  - =0.5-0.9= Miscellaneous text modifications, trying to put shorter snippets first
+ =1= (/default/)
+ =2= Tables and figures
+ =3= Miscellaneous short content
+ =4= Fancy boxes

***** Preamble Generation
Once a list of required features has been determined, we want to use
~org-latex-feature-implementations~ to generate the LaTeX which should be inserted
into the preamble to provide those features.

First we want to process our fancy keywords in ~org-latex-feature-implementations~
to produce an /expanded/ list of features. We'll do that by performing the
following steps.
+ The dependencies for each listed feature are added to feature list
  (src_elisp{:requires}).
+ The src_elisp{:when} conditions of each feature, and available features with
  src_elisp{:eager t}, are evaluated, and added/removed accordingly
+ Any features present in a src_elisp{:prevents} value are removed
+ The feature list is scrubbed of duplicates
+ The feature list is sorted by src_elisp{:order} (ascending)

                       ((pred functionp) (funcall snippet features))
                       ((pred listp) (eval `(let ((features ',features)) (,@snippet))))
                       ((pred symbolp) (symbol-value snippet))
                       (_ (user-error "org-latex-feature-implementations :snippet value %s unable to be used" snippet)))
                     "\n")))
                expanded-features
                "")
     "% end features\n")))
#+end_src

Then Org needs to be advised to actually use this generated preamble content.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar info--tmp nil)

(defadvice! org-latex-save-info (info &optional t_ s_)
  :before #'org-latex-make-preamble
  (setq info--tmp info))

(defadvice! org-splice-latex-header-and-generated-preamble-a (orig-fn tpl def-pkg pkg snippets-p &optional extra)
  "Dynamically insert preamble content based on `org-latex-conditional-preambles'."
  :around #'org-splice-latex-header
  (let ((header (funcall orig-fn tpl def-pkg pkg snippets-p extra)))
    (if snippets-p header
      (concat header
              (org-latex-generate-features-preamble (org-latex-detect-features nil info--tmp))
              "\n"))))
#+end_src

My use of ~info--tmp~ is somewhat hacky. When I try to upstream this, this should
become much cleaner as I can pass info through by directly modifying
~org-latex-make-preamble~.
***** Reduce Default Packages
Thanks to our additions, we can remove a few packages from
~org-latex-default-packages-alist~.

There are also some obsolete entries in the default value, specifically
+ =grffile='s capabilities are built into the current version of =graphicx=
+ =textcomp='s functionality has been included in LaTeX's core for a while now

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-default-packages-alist
      '(("AUTO" "inputenc" t ("pdflatex"))
        ("T1" "fontenc" t ("pdflatex"))
        ("" "xcolor" nil) ; Generally useful
        ("" "hyperref" nil)))
#+end_src
**** Font Collections
Using the lovely conditional preamble, I'll define a number of font collections
that can be used for \LaTeX exports. Who knows, maybe I'll use it with other
export formats too at some point.

To start with I'll create a default state variable and register =fontset= as part
of =#+options=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-latex-default-fontset 'alegreya
  "Fontset from `org-latex-fontsets' to use by default.
As cm (computer modern) is TeX's default, that causes nothing
to be added to the document.

If \"nil\" no custom fonts will ever be used.")

(eval '(cl-pushnew '(:latex-font-set nil "fontset" org-latex-default-fontset)
                   (org-export-backend-options (org-export-get-backend 'latex))))
#+end_src

Then a function is needed to generate a \LaTeX snippet which applies the fontset. It
would be nice if this could be done for individual styles and use different
styles as the main document font. If the individual typefaces for a fontset are
defined individually as
src_elisp{:serif}, src_elisp{:sans}, src_elisp{:mono}, and src_elisp{:maths}.
I can use those to generate \LaTeX for subsets of the full fontset. Then, if I
don't let any fontset names have =-= in them, I can use =-sans= and =-mono= as
suffixes that specify the document font to use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-fontset-entry ()
  "Get the fontset spec of the current file.
Has format \"name\" or \"name-style\" where 'name' is one of
the cars in `org-latex-fontsets'."
  (let ((fontset-spec
         (symbol-name
          (or (car (delq nil
                         (mapcar
                          (lambda (opt-line)
                            (plist-get (org-export--parse-option-keyword opt-line 'latex)
                                       :latex-font-set))
                          (cdar (org-collect-keywords '("OPTIONS"))))))
              org-latex-default-fontset))))
    (cons (intern (car (split-string fontset-spec "-")))
          (when (cadr (split-string fontset-spec "-"))
            (intern (concat ":" (cadr (split-string fontset-spec "-"))))))))

(defun org-latex-fontset (&rest desired-styles)
  "Generate a LaTeX preamble snippet which applies the current fontset for DESIRED-STYLES."
  (let* ((fontset-spec (org-latex-fontset-entry))
         (fontset (alist-get (car fontset-spec) org-latex-fontsets)))
    (if fontset
        (concat
         (mapconcat
          (lambda (style)
            (when (plist-get fontset style)
              (concat (plist-get fontset style) "\n")))
          desired-styles
          "")
         (when (memq (cdr fontset-spec) desired-styles)
           (pcase (cdr fontset-spec)
             (:serif "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\rmdefault}\n")
             (:sans "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\sfdefault}\n")
             (:mono "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\ttdefault}\n"))))
      (error "Font-set %s is not provided in org-latex-fontsets" (car fontset-spec)))))
#+end_src

Now that all the functionality has been implemented, we should hook it into our
preamble generation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '(org-latex-default-fontset . custom-font) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(custom-font :snippet (org-latex-fontset :serif :sans :mono) :order 0) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(.custom-maths-font :eager t :when (custom-font maths) :snippet (org-latex-fontset :maths) :order 0.3) t)
#+end_src

Finally, we just need to add some fonts.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-latex-fontsets
  '((cm nil) ; computer modern
    (## nil) ; no font set
    (alegreya
     :serif "\\usepackage[osf]{Alegreya}"
     :sans "\\usepackage{AlegreyaSans}"
     :mono "\\usepackage[scale=0.88]{sourcecodepro}"

     :maths "\\usepackage{newtxmath}") ; may be sourceserifpro-based in future
    (times

     :maths "\\usepackage{newtxmath}"))
  "Alist of fontset specifications.

#+end_src

When we're using Alegreya we can apply a lovely little tweak to =tabular= which
(locally) changes the figures used to lining fixed-width.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '((string= (car (org-latex-fontset-entry)) "alegreya") . alegreya-typeface))
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(alegreya-typeface) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations'(.alegreya-tabular-figures :eager t :when (alegreya-typeface table) :order 0.5 :snippet "
\\makeatletter
% tabular lining figures in tables
\\renewcommand{\\tabular}{\\AlegreyaTLF\\let\\@halignto\\@empty\\@tabular}
\\makeatother\n") t)
#+end_src

Due to the Alegreya's metrics, the =\LaTeX= symbol doesn't quite look right. We
can correct for this by redefining it with subtlety shifted kerning.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '("LaTeX" . latex-symbol))
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(latex-symbol :when alegreya-typeface :order 0.5 :snippet "

#+end_src

**** Cover Page

To make a nice cover page, a simple method that comes to mind is just redefining
=\maketitle=. To get precise control over the positioning we'll use the =tikz=
package, and then add in the Tikz libraries =calc= and =shapes.geometric= to make
some nice decorations for the background.

I'll start off by setting up the required additions to the preamble.
This will accomplish the following:
+ Load the required packages
+ Redefine =\maketitle=
+ Draw an Org icon with Tikz to use in the cover page (it's a little easter egg)
+ Start a new page after the table of contents by redefining =\tableofcontents=

#+name: latex-cover-page

Now we've got a nice cover page to work with, we just need to use it every now
and then. Adding this to =#+options= feels most appropriate.
Let's have the =coverpage= option accept =auto= as a value and then decide whether
or not a cover page should be used based on the word count --- I'll have this be
the global default. Then we just want to insert a LaTeX snippet tweak the
subtitle format to use the cover page.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(defvar org-latex-cover-page 'auto
  "When t, use a cover page by default.
When auto, use a cover page when the document's wordcount exceeds
`org-latex-cover-page-wordcount-threshold'.

Set with #+option: coverpage:{yes,auto,no} in org buffers.")
(defvar org-latex-cover-page-wordcount-threshold 5000
  "Document word count at which a cover page will be used automatically.
This condition is applied when cover page option is set to auto.")
(defvar org-latex-subtitle-coverpage-format "\\\\\\bigskip\n\\LARGE\\mdseries\\itshape\\color{black!80} %s\\par"
  "Variant of `org-latex-subtitle-format' to use with the cover page.")
(defvar org-latex-cover-page-maketitle "

"
  "LaTeX snippet for the preamble that sets \\maketitle to produce a cover page.")

(eval '(cl-pushnew '(:latex-cover-page nil "coverpage" org-latex-cover-page)
                   (org-export-backend-options (org-export-get-backend 'latex))))

(defun org-latex-cover-page-p ()

                       (plist-get (org-export--parse-option-keyword opt-line 'latex) :latex-cover-page))
                     (cdar (org-collect-keywords '("OPTIONS"))))))
             org-latex-cover-page)

**** Condensed Lists
LaTeX is generally pretty good by default, but it's /really/ generous with how
much space it puts between list items by default. I'm generally not a fan.

Thankfully this is easy to correct with a small snippet:
#+name: latex-condense-lists
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\let\\olditem\\itemize\\renewcommand{\\itemize}{\\olditem\\setlength{\\itemsep}{-2ex}}
\\let\\oldenum\\enumerate\\renewcommand{\\enumerate}{\\oldenum\\setlength{\\itemsep}{-2ex}}
\\let\\olddesc\\description\\renewcommand{\\description}{\\olddesc\\setlength{\\itemsep}{-2ex}}
#+end_src

Then we can just hook this in with our clever preamble.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(defvar org-latex-condense-lists t
  "Reduce the space between list items.")
(defvar org-latex-condensed-lists "
<<latex-condense-lists>>
")

(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '((and org-latex-condense-lists "^[ \t]*[-+]\\|^[ \t]*[1Aa][.)] ") . condensed-lists) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(condensed-lists :snippet org-latex-condensed-lists :order 0.7) t)
#+end_src

**** Pretty Code Blocks
We could just use minted for syntax highlighting --- however, we can do better!
The =engrave-faces= package lets us use Emacs' font-lock for syntax highlighting,
exporting that as LaTeX commands.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle packages.el
(package! engrave-faces
  :recipe (:host github :repo "tecosaur/engrave-faces")
  :pin "8bbaaf853314fcdcc98383a05ae1313c901eaa5a")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle yes
(use-package! engrave-faces-latex
  :after ox-latex)
#+end_src

We'll modify the way listings are generated to make using this as easy as:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-listings 'engraved) ; NOTE non-standard value
#+end_src

Thanks to ~org-latex-conditional-features~ and some copy-paste with the =minted=
entry in ~org-latex-scr-block~ we can easily add this as a recognised
~org-latex-listings~ value.

#+end_src

Whenever this is used, in order for it to actually work (and look a little
better) we add bit to the preamble:

#+name: org-latex-engraved-code-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\usepackage{fvextra}
\\fvset{
  commandchars=\\\\\\{\\},
  highlightcolor=white!95!black!80!blue,
  breaklines=true,
  breaksymbol=\\color{white!60!black}\\tiny\\ensuremath{\\hookrightarrow}}
\\renewcommand\\theFancyVerbLine{\\footnotesize\\color{black!40!white}\\arabic{FancyVerbLine}}

\\definecolor{codebackground}{HTML}{f7f7f7}
\\definecolor{codeborder}{HTML}{f0f0f0}

% TODO have code boxes keep line vertical alignment
\\usepackage[breakable,xparse]{tcolorbox}
\\DeclareTColorBox[]{Code}{o}%
{colback=codebackground, colframe=codeborder,
  fontupper=\\footnotesize,
  colupper=EFD,
  IfNoValueTF={#1}%
  {boxsep=2pt, arc=2.5pt, outer arc=2.5pt,
    boxrule=0.5pt, left=2pt}%
  {boxsep=2.5pt, arc=0pt, outer arc=0pt,
    boxrule=0pt, leftrule=1.5pt, left=0.5pt},
  right=2pt, top=1pt, bottom=0.5pt,
  breakable}
#+end_src

At some point it would be nice to make the box colours easily customisable. At
the moment it's fairly easy to change the syntax highlighting colours with
src_elisp{(setq engrave-faces-preset-styles (engrave-faces-generate-preset))},
but perhaps a toggle which specifies whether to use the default values, the
current theme, or any named theme could be a good idea. It should also possible
to set the box background dynamically to match. The named theme could work by
looking for a style definition with a certain name in a cache dir, and then
switching to that theme and producing (and saving) the style definition if it
doesn't exist.

Now let's have the example block be styled similarly.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-latex-example-block-engraved (orig-fn example-block contents info)
  "Like `org-latex-example-block', but supporting an engraved backend"
  :around #'org-latex-example-block
  (let ((output-block (funcall orig-fn example-block contents info)))
    (if (eq 'engraved (plist-get info :latex-listings))
        (format "\\begin{Code}[alt]\n%s\n\\end{Code}" output-block)
      output-block)))
#+end_src

In addition to the vastly superior visual output, this should also be much
faster to compile for code-heavy documents (like this config).

Performing a little benchmark with this document, I find that this is indeed the
case.

| LaTeX syntax highlighting backend | Compile time | Overhead | Overhead ratio |
|-----------------------------------+--------------+----------+----------------|
| verbatim                          | 12 s         | 0        |            0.0 |
| lstlistings                       | 15 s         | 3 s      |            0.2 |
| Engrave                           | 34 s         | 22 s     |            1.8 |
| Pygments (Minted)                 | 184 s        | 172 s    |           14.3 |
#+TBLFM: $3=$2-@2$2::$4=$3 / @2$2;%.1f

Treating the verbatim (no syntax highlighting) result as a baseline; this
rudimentary test suggest that =engrave-faces= is around eight times faster than
=pygments=, and takes three times as long as no syntax highlighting (verbatim).
**** Remove Non-ASCII Characters
When using ~pdflatex~, almost non-ascii characters are generally problematic, and
don't appear in the pdf. It's preferable to see that there was /some/ character
which wasn't displayed as opposed to nothing.

We check every non-ascii character to make sure it's not a character encoded by
the =inputenc= packages when loaded with the =utf8= option. Finally, we see if we
have our own LaTeX conversion we can apply and if there is none we replace the
non-ascii char with =¿=.

No to make sure we only remove characters that can't be displayed, we check
=/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/utf8enc.dfu=.

We just need to make sure this is appended to the list of filter functions,
since we want to let emoji processing occur first.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar +org-pdflatex-inputenc-encoded-chars

  (when (and (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex)
             (string= (plist-get info :latex-compiler) "pdflatex"))
    (let (case-replace)
      (replace-regexp-in-string "[^[:ascii:]]"
                                (lambda (nonascii)
                                  (if (string-match-p +org-pdflatex-inputenc-encoded-chars nonascii) nonascii
                                    (or (cdr (assoc nonascii +org-latex-non-ascii-char-substitutions)) "¿")))
                                text))))

(add-to-list 'org-export-filter-final-output-functions #'+org-latex-replace-non-ascii-chars t)
#+end_src

Now, there are some symbols that aren't included in =inputenc=, but we should be
able to handle anyway. For them we define a table of LaTeX translations

conversion of =...= to =\ldots{}= is hardcoded into ~org-latex-plain-text~ (unlike

**** Make Verbatim Different To Code
Since have just gone to so much effort above let's make the most of it by making
=verbatim= use ~verb~ instead of ~protectedtexttt~ (default).

This gives the same advantages as mentioned in the [[*Make verbatim different to code][HTML export section]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-text-markup-alist
      '((bold . "\\textbf{%s}")
        (code . protectedtexttt)
        (italic . "\\emph{%s}")
        (strike-through . "\\sout{%s}")
        (underline . "\\uline{%s}")
        (verbatim . verb)))
#+end_src
**** No AucTeX please
For some reason, the way that ~org-export-to-file~ works, I find that =latex-mode=
is called on the produced buffer prior to saving. This has two undesirable
side-effects:
+ I get unwanted warnings from AuxTeX
+ A spurious =.auctex-auto= folder is produced.

There are a few ways I could try to avoid this, but the most obvious to me is
locally binding ~auto-mode-alist~ to ~nil~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! no-auto-mode-alist (orig-fn &rest args)
  "Wrap ORIG-FN in a let-binding that sets `auto-mode-alist' to nil."
  :around #'org-export-to-file
  (let ((auto-mode-alist nil))
    (apply orig-fn args)))
#+end_src
** LaTeX
*** To-be-implemented ideas
- Paste image from clipboard
  + Determine first folder in ~graphicspath~ if applicable
  + Ask for file name
  + Use ~xclip~ to save file to graphics folder, or current directory (whichever applies)
  #+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle no
command -v xclip >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&1 "no xclip"; exit 1; }

if
    xclip -selection clipboard -target image/png -o >/dev/null 2>&1
then
    xclip -selection clipboard -target image/png -o >$1 2>/dev/null
    echo $1
else
    echo "no image"
fi
  #+end_src
  + Insert figure, with filled in details as a result (activate =yasnippet= with
    filename as variable maybe?)
*** Compilation
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq TeX-save-query nil
      TeX-show-compilation t
      TeX-command-extra-options "-shell-escape")

For viewing the PDF, I rather like the pdf-tools viewer. While auctex is trying
to be nice in recognising that I have some PDF viewing apps installed, I'd
rather not have it default to using them, so let's re-order the preferences.

Most of the time when I write markdown, it's going into some app/website which
will do it's own line wrapping, hence we /only/ want to use visual line wrapping. No hard stuff.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! (gfm-mode markdown-mode) #'visual-line-mode #'turn-off-auto-fill)
#+end_src

Since markdown is often seen as rendered HTML, let's try to somewhat mirror the
style or markdown renderers.

Most markdown renders seem to make the first three headings levels larger than
normal text, the first two much so. Then the fourth level tends to be the same
as body text, while the fifth and sixth are (increasingly) smaller, with the
sixth greyed out. Since the sixth level is so small, I'll turn up the boldness a notch.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(markdown-header-face-1 :height 1.25 :weight extra-bold :inherit markdown-header-face)
  '(markdown-header-face-2 :height 1.15 :weight bold       :inherit markdown-header-face)
  '(markdown-header-face-3 :height 1.08 :weight bold       :inherit markdown-header-face)
  '(markdown-header-face-4 :height 1.00 :weight bold       :inherit markdown-header-face)
  '(markdown-header-face-5 :height 0.90 :weight bold       :inherit markdown-header-face)
  '(markdown-header-face-6 :height 0.75 :weight extra-bold :inherit markdown-header-face))
